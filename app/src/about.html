      <h6 class="">Luncho is a common unit of currencies for mitigating the economic inequality among countries.</h6>

      For economic inequality inside a country, use <a href="https://rq.land/help" target="_blank">Requestland</a>.
    </section>


    <section>
      <h4> Useful for you?</h4>

      It's useful for currency conversion on pricing pages, for example. It must be useful for

      <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>Digital service providers for growth</li>
        <li>Global companies for paying wages</li>
        <li>Marketers for pricing and growth</li>
        <li>Donors for donation</li>
        <li>Journalists for justice</li>
        <li>Economists for writing good papers</li>
        <li>Teachers for the future</li>
      </ul>
      Or, you are encouraged to request them to use Luncho.

      <p>It is not intended to be used inside a country.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>Luncho shows the same value in every country
      </h4>

      <p>
        Luncho is a common value index among currencies. A luncho value shows the same value in any
        country taking its price levels into account. For example, with 100 Luncho, you can have simple lunch
        in India, Brazil, USA, Japan, and other countries.</p>

      <p>In India 100 Luncho is equivalent to 191 Rupee ($2.31 US dollars), while the same 100 Luncho
        is equivalent to 20.91 Real ($3.96) in Brazil. In USA, 100 Luncho is about $7.97.
        All are the same value because everything is just 100 Luncho.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4 class="">The inequality problem</h4>

      <p>
        Among many causes of the economic inequality problem, Luncho will contribute to overcome two major problems. One is the rapid progress of information technology (IT) that is enlarging the gap between countries which are utilizing IT and the rest of coutries which do not. People living in developing countries cannot buy advanced digital services because of their high prices. Another reason is decreasing worker's share.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>Solution and examples</h4>

      <p>
        To solve to the IT gap, for example, anyone must have access to the latest digital services
        for commerce, productivity, life, entertainment and so on at affordable prices. We know
        people working on the digital services want to provide their services at appropriate prices
        in countries, but we have not had a good measure to do so. That's the reason why we should
        use the common unit of pricing that has the same value in every country.
      </p>

      <p>Luncho is a common value index among currencies made for that. A luncho value shows the
        same value in every country taking its price levels into account. Because it doesn't depend on a
        specific currency, it's neutral and fair.
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, Salesforce provides great IT services for sales. They provide Professional sales cloud for <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/editions-pricing/sales-cloud" target="_blank">$75 per user per month in the world</a>.</p>
      <p>$75 would be fine for people in the US, but how about people in Pakistan? The price level of Pakistan is one of five of the US. </p>

      <p>
        In such case they can define their pricing in Luncho. You can find that $75 is 941 Luncho on the converter and imagine that the 941 Luncho is for about 10 lunches.</p>

      <p>The converter teaches that 941 Luncho is 3873 Pakistan Rupee. That is for about 10 lunches and $13.7 USD.</p>

      <p>Also in Switzerland 941 Luncho is 61.4 Euro. That is also for about 10 lunches and $65 USD.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>In the US</dt>
        <dd>$75 per month, (941 Luncho)</dd>
        <dt>In Pakistan</dt>
        <dd>3873 Rupee per month (941 Luncho, $13.7 USD)</dd>
        <dt>In Switzerland</dt>
        <dd>€76.3 Euro per month (941 Luncho, $82.1 USD)</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Another example is the payment of workers' wage. You can define a pay in Luncho, 50,000 Luncho for example, for a job. All workers for the job who live in different countries will experience the same living standard.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>In Philippines</dt>
        <dd>Job A:  74,878 Philippine Piso per month (50000 Luncho, $1364 USD)</dd>
        <dt>In Japan</dt>
        <dd>Job A:  350,122 Yen per month (50000 Luncho, $2637 USD)</dd>
        <dt>In the US</dt>
        <dd>Job A:  $3,987 USD per month, (50000 Luncho)</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>Factor</h4>

      <p>What if Salesforce thinks that the $13.7 USD would be too cheap for their product in Pakistan, as the price in the US is $75?</p>

      <p>They can use the <i>factor slider</i> in the <a href="countries">countries page</a> to find out prices that are compatible with profit and equality in countries.</p>

      <p>You will see that the graph has a red line and it moves according to the slider value. 100% takes the price level into account 100%, while 0 does not at all. As its pivot is the United States, the values of countries above the US are decreased, while the values of countries below US are increased.</p>

      <p>Here are reculculated values with factor 50%.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>In the US</dt>
        <dd>$75 per month, (941 Luncho)</dd>
        <dt>In Pakistan</dt>
        <dd>1974 Rupee per month (941 Luncho, $44.38 USD)</dd>
        <dt>In Switzerland</dt>
        <dd>€75.66 Euro per month (941 Luncho, $78.54 USD)</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Note that the new value $44.38 USD is the middle of the US price $75 and the original value $13.7 without factor in Pakistan, because the factor is 50%.</p>

      <h4>How it works?</h4>

      <p><b>100 Luncho is 6 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR">SDR </a></b>.</p>

      <p>
        A Luncho value in a country is calculated into the local currency of the country using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/faq.htm#q4d">implied Purchase Power Parity (PPP)</a>, and exchange rates.</b>

        <p>
          Thus, Luncho reflects the overall price level of each country, <b>not actual lunch prices</b>. It is not for comparing lunch prices.
        </p>

        <p>
          A PPP is a theoretical exchange rate that reflects the price level of a country against
          US Dollar, that is, how expensive goods and services are in the country. Our PPP
          data uses <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2022/October">IMF World Economic Outlook Database (October, 2022)</a> and it is based on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp">the
          latest International Comparison Program (ICP)</a> led by the World Bank. The ICP investigates price levels of <a target="_blank" href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33623/9781464815300.pdf">many
          items such as bread, pork, cheese, sugar, gas, medical services, cars, etc.</a> in each
          country every five years. The PPP data on IMF World Economic Outlook is adjusted every year using the defrator of each country.
        </p>

        <p>
          The exchange rates of SDR (code XDR) is made from a fixed weight of exchange rates of five currencies,
          US Dollar, Euro, GB Pound, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan. Because Luncho is defined on SDR,
          it is not very sensitive against the fluctuation of US dollar. The SDR and exchange rate data are
          updated at 00:06 UTC every day on the Luncho server.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ratio between Luncho and SDR must be changed according to the change of overall price levels due to inflation and the long term growth of the world economy. In 2022, 100 Luncho is 6 SDR. That may be too small for people in urban areas and enough for people in rural areas.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 4rem;">
          local_currency_value = luncho_value * PPP * (SDR_per_Luncho / SDR_per_Dollar)
        </p>

        where
        <ul>
          <li>SDR_per_Luncho = 6.</li>
          <li>PPP = Country's implied Purchase Power Parity (PPP) value of this year</li>
          <li>SDR_per_Dollar = Today's exchange rate of IMF's Special Drawing Right (SDR) per US
            dollar</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Limitations</h4>

      <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>Due to the inflation "100 Luncho for 6 SDR" may be a bit obsolete in some countries. We need to fix the definition.</li>
        <li>PPP conversion rate is updated irregularly and does not reflect monthly inflation
          data. Sorry for inconvenience.</li>
        <li>
          The Luncho calculation reflects the PPP value of a target country and the daily exchange rate of SDR, but does not the daily exchange rate of the target country. The daily exchange rate of the target country is reflected only once a year when Dr Hirano replaces PPP data with the year's PPP estimation from IMF World Economic Outlook</a>. See <a href="https://github.com/HIRANO-Satoshi/luncho/issues/24" target="_blank">this issue for detail</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Although you can expect to have simple lunch in restaurants for local residents with 100
          Luncho, restaurants for tourists must be much more expensive.
        </li>
        <li>There may be differences of price levels in a country. For example, it's cheap in rural areas while expensive in urban areas. The Luncho does not reflect such difference. You can see <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HIRANO-Satoshi/luncho/blob/master/server/data/Data_Extract_From_ICP_2017_Metadata.csv">one of our data files that we got from the ICP web site</a> to know how the PPP data was acquired in each country. Here are two examples from it. In Cambodia they investigated both urban and rural areas, while they did only urban areas in Colombia.
